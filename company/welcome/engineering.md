## Setting up your Machine

**Academy Engineers** - There will be a scheduled [workshop](https://github.com/madetech/learn/tree/master/workshops/00-Setup-Workshop) that will get your machine setup for development.

Otherwise, to get your machine set up with some essentials we've created [First Boot](https://github.com/madetech/first-boot).

First Boot will install applications like Chrome, Slack, and Sequel Pro as well as installing the latest version of Ruby using `rbenv`, and the latest version of Node using `nvm`.
